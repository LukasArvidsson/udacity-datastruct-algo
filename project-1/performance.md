# Performance analysis

## Project 1: Unscramble Computer Science Problems

### Task 0

The program should run in O(1) if not considering the runtime of the built in python functions like stepping through a list.

### Task 1

The program should run in O(2n) if not considering the runtime of the built in python functions like add. This since the program has two for loops while all other statements are O(1).

### Task 2

The program should run in O(n log n) if we consider that the program uses that python sort method.

### Task 3

The program should run in O(n log n) if we consider that the program uses that python sort method.

### Task 4

The program should run in O(n log n) if we consider that the program uses that python sort method.
