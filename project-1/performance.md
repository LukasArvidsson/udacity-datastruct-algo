# Performance analysis

## Project 1: Unscramble Computer Science Problems

### Task 0

The program should run in O(1) if not considering the runtime of the built in python functions like stepping through a list.

### Task 1

The program should run in O(2n) if not considering the runtime of the built in python functions like add. This since the program has two for loops while all other statements are O(1).

### Task 2

The program should run in O(n) if we consider that the program uses that python max method. The for loop runs in O(n), the max runs also in O(n).

### Task 3

The program should run in O(n log n) if we consider that the program uses that python sort method. We have three for loops that runs in O(n), and we have the sordted which runs in O(n log n), therefore the final efficiency is O(n log n), the if statements are O(1) which makes their impact on efficiency very small.

### Task 4

The program should run in O(n log n) if we consider that the program uses that python sort method. We have also four for loops which runs in O(n).
