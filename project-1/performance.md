# Performance analysis

## Project 1: Unscramble Computer Science Problems

### Task 0

The program should run in O(1) if not considering the runtime of the built in python functions like stepping through a list.

### Task 1

The program should run in O(2n) if not considering the runtime of the built in python functions like add.

### Task 2

The program should run in O(n) if not considering the runtime of the built in python functions like sorted.

### Task 3

The program should run in O(3n) if not considering the runtime of the built in python functions like sorted. This since the program has three for loops

### Task 4

The program should run in O(4n) if not considering the runtime of the built in python functions..
